# 🧠 Overview

Drug-induced neurotoxicity is a major challenge during drug discovery and development. Traditional laboratory evaluation is often expensive and time-consuming, motivating the development of computational approaches for early toxicity screening.

This project presents a machine learning pipeline that predicts the neurotoxicity potential of chemical compounds using molecular descriptors generated from their chemical structures. The workflow integrates chemoinformatics, feature engineering, and supervised machine learning to classify compounds as neurotoxic or neuroprotective.

The complete pipeline covers:

- Curating neuroactive compounds
- Retrieving molecular structures from PubChem
- Generating molecular descriptors using RDKit
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Model evaluation and prediction of novel compounds
